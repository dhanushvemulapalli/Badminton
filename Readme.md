# Goal: 

Build a computer vision pipeline that analyzes badminton player performance from video and produces technical + tactical insights with 3D visualization for:

Stance & footwork

Stroke mechanics

Posture and jump

Serve legality

Reaction timing

Great — that’s a clear and ambitious feature list, and we can absolutely structure the system to analyze these systematically.

Here’s how I suggest we break this down into concrete motion analysis modules, each of which will be developed step by step:

---

### ✅ 1. **Stance & Court Movement** = Done

**Goal**: Detect key footwork techniques like split-step, lunge, chasse, and transitions between positions.

**We'll track**:

* Distance and angle between knees, hips, and ankles.
* Center of mass movement (from hip average).
* Step timings & foot spacing.

---

### ✅ 2. **Stroke Mechanics** = Done

**Goal**: Analyze the player's arm motion for different types of shots.

**We'll track**:

* Elbow–wrist–shoulder angles over time.
* Velocity of the wrist (proxy for racket head speed).
* Approximate contact point from arm extension and wrist snap.

---

### ✅ 3. **Shot-specific Posture**

**Goal**: Determine jump smashes, rotation for clears, and posture consistency across strokes.

**We'll track**:

* Jump detection using feet z-values.
* Torso and hip rotation (angle between shoulders and hips).
* Follow-through using elbow/wrist motion post-impact.

---

### ✅ 4. **Serve Legality**

**Goal**: Detect faults like too-high elbow, shoulder lifts, or illegal wrist positions during serves.

**We'll track**:

* Wrist vs. elbow vs. shoulder y-coordinates during serve.
* Angle thresholds for legal serve posture (especially doubles).

---

### ✅ 5. **Reaction Timing**

**Goal**: Estimate reaction speed by tracking latency after opponent’s move.

**We'll track**:

* Change detection on opponent’s side → timer starts.
* Movement initiation on player's side → timer ends.
* Use distance moved after opponent shot as proxy for reaction quality.
